This helloProcessing sample shows how to run the Intel(R) Perceptual 
Computing SDK inside the Processing* framework.

The sample is tested under Processing 1.5.1 and 2.0 beta 7.

The SDK functions are exposed in a simplified pipeline interface 
under intel.pcsdk.PXCUPipeline. The pipeline hard-coded RGB capturing, 
finger/hand tracking, gesture recognition, face location, landmark
detection, and voice recognition. See sdkmanual-framework.pdf for
details.

To run this sample, do the following: 
(1) Copy the libraries directory to your sketch location. You can find
your sketch location from File->Preference. To verify, relaunch Processing
and go to sketch/import, you should see PXCUPipeline in the sub-menu.
(2) Click on the helloProcessing/helloProcessing.pde to launch the 
Processing application.
(3) Run the sample.
